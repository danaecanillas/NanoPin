# NanoPin

Project submitted at Datathon 2022 organized by the AED (UPC). The Cracking the Nano team has obtained third place.

## Challenge
Project proposed by Qualcomm, a company that creates semiconductors, software, and services related to wireless technology. The goal of the challenge is to design a circuit that connects a set of chip pins optimally using the shortest length of wire. This path can be subdivided into different chains (clusters) connected to a set of driver pins that supply power.

## Solution
